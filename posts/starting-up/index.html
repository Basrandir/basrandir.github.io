<p>
I’ve decided to actually create a website in order to document my
learning as well as interesting information or methodology I stumble
across. Essentially a way for me to keep track of certain details that
I might need to refer back to. Maybe it’ll be helpful for others too.
</p>

<p>
Up to this point I’ve used a self-hosted wiki to manage this type of
information (as well as cooking recipes). This blog is meant to be
essentially an extension of that with more detail and my thought
process and reasoning behind the decisions I make. Over time I’ll
probably transfer some information from the wiki over to here in a
nicer format.

Static site generators had always interested me. I’d had enough
experience with overwrought dynamic CMSs to be a little tired of
them. I really don’t see the need for them for my small little
website. I also generally like to be as close as possible to the
actual code as I can. Abstractions on top of abstractions get a little
tedious for me.
</p>

<p>
This isn’t my first time experimenting with static site generators. I
actually built one myself for a client’s website a few years ago. It
was more of a programming project than an attempt at a viable,
commercial generator. I used Python for the actual generator while
making use of the Jinja2 template engine. Honestly I was pretty proud
of it. Especially for what amounted to a weekends worth of work.
</p>

<p>
A few days ago when I actually decided to set up this website I
considered using my own generator for this site. But I quickly
realized that it would need quite a bit of work to function as an
actual blog generator. And among the publicly available generators,
Jekyll was used automatically by Github Pages (which this site is
hosted on). Hence my decision. It doesn’t hurt that Jekyll is the most
popular and so there’s a lot of resources available for it. Finally, I
have zero experience with Ruby so it might be a nice learning tool if
I ever end up going into the nitty-gritty of Jekyll.

Creating a Github site for myself was fairly straightforward. A simple
repository with a CNAME Record file that let’s Github know my custom
domain. And finally a few A Records with my domain pointed to
Github. It’s incredibly simple and straightforward.
</p>

<p>
Setting up Ruby on my computer was an interesting experience. I
recently got a Macbook Pro which would be my first experience with OS
X since a Grade 10 Communications course. So I figured I’d set it up
first on the Macbook rather than my Linux box. The first thing
everyone seems to recommend is to install Homebrew, the presumably
best package manager on OS X. From there it’s on to setting up Ruby.
</p>

<p>
There’s a lot of different ways of setting up Ruby installs it
seems. My version of OS X came with Ruby 2.0.0 pre-installed but I
wanted the latest stable which, at the time of writing, was
2.2.3. There’s a multitude of ways to accomplish this but I settled on
using ruby-install for the actual installation and chruby to manage
the various Ruby installs.
</p>

<p>
The next step was configuring my Ruby environment. Bundler is helpful
in this because it ensures all the Ruby gems match the correct version
needed. All I had to do was create a simply Gemfile file with the
names of all the gems I wanted (and their specific versions if
needed). In my case the only gem I needed was Jekyll.
</p>

<p>
I forwent using the github-pages gem in favour of setting up my Jekyll
system myself. After Bundler installed Jekyll, all I had to do was run
<code>jekyll new .</code> in my repository. Jekyll then built the entire framework
which I haven’t touched at all so far. The only change will be this
post.

Going forward I’m going to keep this website incredibly
simple. There’s going to be a design change from this default Jekyll
skin but I doubt I’ll be doing anything truly fancy. I generally
prefer a minimalistic style but we’ll see if I’ll build something a
little more complex than Richard Stallman’s website.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully this’ll be fun.
</p>

<p>
Or at least interesting.
